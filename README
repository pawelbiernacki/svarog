An experimental AI language based on an algorithm with the hidden variables.

See www.perkun.org for svarog documentation.

This package contains three programs and a library.

- svarog 				- a Svarog interpreter
- svarog-daemon			- a daemon to be used when multiple machines are available
- svarog-dummy-client	- an auxilliary program to connect to svarog-daemon
- libsvarog				- a C++ library to use Svarog in your own programs

If the machine running svarog (the interpreter or any program based on it) has a section "servers"
in its config file then it may delegate the subproblems to be solved by the servers (svarog-daemons).
