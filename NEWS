version 0.0.4:
	svarog has a new command:

	cout << precalculate(depth,granularity) << eol;

	It is creating a Svarog specification containing precalculated knowledge
	and printing it out to the standard output.
	The depth is the "intelligence level" (the game tree depth) - just like in the loop command.
	Granularity is the amount of probability values for a single state in the belief, it should
	be small (2 is a good choice). It must not be 1 or smaller.
	
	After parsing a specification with the precalculated knowledge Svarog
	will be able to use it as a cache.

	If the amount of the beliefs after the discretization of the belief set exceeds 1024
	then the visible state is marked as "too complex" and not considered in the precalculations.
	Each visible state is checked individually, its impossible states are not taken into account when doing the precalculations.
